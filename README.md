# Work-Day-Scheduler
A calendar application to help the user schedule a work day by hour

## About the project
I have created a work day scheduling application using javascript, HTML and CSS code. The application displays the current day and date at the top. There is then a table with 8 rows, one for each hour of the day from 9am to 5pm. The user can enter text into the text area of the rows and save it, this acts as a to do list for the day ahead. Upon saving the entry, by pressing the save button at the end of the row, the entry will remain in the text area even if the page is refreshed. The background color of the text areas also ajust automatially with the time, if the hour is current it turns green, if the hour has past it turns grey, and if the hour is in the future it turns red.
